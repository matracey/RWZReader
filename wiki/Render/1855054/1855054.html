<p><b>Project Description</b><br>
This project is aimed at creating a utility to better manage the rules in Microsoft Outlook. The rules manager for Outlook has not changed in many revisions and it is very difficult to organize a large quantity of rules.
</p>
<p>The original, unreleased source code, posted in 2013, provided a means to manipulate the Outlook rules export file (*.RWZ).&nbsp; The basic process was to export the rules to a file, use the utility to organize the rules, delete the rules from Outlook, then
 import the modified rules export file.</p>
<p>In 2016, the project was revisited and the code was stabilized.&nbsp; This resulted in the first alpha binary release.&nbsp; Since version 1.0.1.0, the projectâ€™s downloadable utility allows direct reading and writing of the rules from Outlook, whether the
 email store is a PST file or Exchange.&nbsp; The primary function remains to allow the sorting of rules.</p>
<p>A longer-term plan is to provide a means to edit the individual rules and provide a more flexible interface for Outlook rules management.&nbsp; This requires reverse-engineering all the rule criteria (about 30) and rule actions (about 25).</p>
